# Aligning Flex Items

In this activity, you’ll practice aligning CSS Flexbox items inside parent containers.

## Instructions

* Open the file `index.html`.

  * This file includes parent containers with child elements. 

* When you open it in your browser, take notice of what it’s missing. 

  * **Hint:** None of the flex children are aligned inside their container. 

* Open the `index.css` file and add the `align-items property` to the `.alignItems` selector.

* Set the value for `align-items` property to center. 

* Save your files and refresh `index.html` in your browser.

* Change the value for `align-items` to `flex-end` or `flex-start` to see the differences that each value creates.

* Add the `justify-content` property to the `.justifyContent` selector.

  * Try out the different values listed here and see what they do to your content.

* Lastly, add properties to the `.perfectlyCentered` selector to center the child element.

  * **Hint:** You will need to use both `align-items` and `justify-content`.

* Your finished design should look like the image below:
